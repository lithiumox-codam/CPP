# CPP00

> This is the first C++ module. It is composed of 3 exercises. (I did not do the last one)

## ex00 - Megaphone

```shell
$> ./megaphone "shhhhh... I think the students are asleep..."
SHHHHH... I THINK THE STUDENTS ARE ASLEEP...
$> ./megaphone Damnit " ! " "Sorry students, I thought this thing was off."
DAMNIT ! SORRY STUDENTS, I THOUGHT THIS THING WAS OFF.
$> ./megaphone
* LOUD AND UNBEARABLE FEEDBACK NOISE *
```

This is a simple program that displays a string on the standard output. However, the string(s) supplied as arguments are looped thru and all alphabet characters are converted to uppercase. If no arguments are supplied, the program displays "**_ LOAD UNBEARABLE NOISE _**" on the standard output.

## ex01 - Phonebook

This is a simple cli tool that functions as a phonebook. It can store up to 8 contacts. The user can add, search, and display contacts. The user can also exit the program by typing "EXIT". If the user tries to add a contact when the phonebook is full, the program will remove the oldest contact and add the new one.
